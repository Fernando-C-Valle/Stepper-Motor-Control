# PIC184550 Stepper Motor Controller

This program is able to control a stepper motor by using a potentiometer.
The potentiometer's value is read using the ADC module and depending on this
value, the controller changes the motor's direction (CW o CCW).

The intention of this project is to perform reading and writing values on the 
controller, using the right pins and modules.
